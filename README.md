### Question: external hardrive which has 4 to 6 GB, not SSD (as that would make the price prohibitive)

I tend to prefer Adata drives. Based out of Taiwan and typically use SK Hynix chips

more for storage space around the 4 to 6 TB range

###　SSD is pretty cheap now, if you aren't interested in SSD what hard drive technology are you considering?



PC running　ｂａｒｅ OS like openELEC or LibreELEC. Connected an external HDD hard drive it plays media files easily enough and fast enough even with only a USB 2.0 connection


 looking more for storage space around the 4 to 6 TB range
 
 ## ＃##＃＃　A quick search shows SSD cost like 4 times for equivalent HDD tech at 4 TB, at least in Australia.
